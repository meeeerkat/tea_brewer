## A tea maker

### TODO
- Put state machine & methods in another file (but not a component in itself as it's too specific to be reused)
- Add an SPI OLED screen to show the current phase & the total time remaining
    (need to make a module for SPI OLED screens first)
- Add a single tea distributor (then multiple)
